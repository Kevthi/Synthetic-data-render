### Steps to Update Blender's NumPy:

1) **Find Blender's Python Executable:**

   - Open Blender.
   - Go to the "Scripting" workspace or open the "Python Console."
   - Run the following command to find Blender's Python executable path:

     ```python
     import sys
     print(sys.executable)
     ```

   - The output will be the path to Blender's Python, such as:

     ```
     /path/to/blender/4.2/python/bin/python3.11
     ```

2) **Uninstall Blender's Current NumPy:**

   - Use the path obtained from the previous step to uninstall NumPy. Note that you may need `sudo` to have the necessary permissions:

     ```bash
     sudo /path/to/blender/4.2/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip uninstall numpy
     ```

3) **Install the Latest Version of NumPy for Blender:**

   - Again, use `sudo` to install the latest version of NumPy:

     ```bash
     sudo /path/to/blender/4.2/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade numpy
     ```

### Additional Notes:

- **Use of `sudo`:** Using `sudo` is necessary because Blender's Python environment might be in a directory where you don't have write permissions as a regular user.
  
- **Blender Installed via Snap:** For Blender installed via Snap, the process is generally the same. However, Snap packages are usually read-only, and you might encounter issues when trying to uninstall or upgrade packages directly. In such cases, it's often easier to download the official Blender version from the Blender website and manage packages in that environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to update Blender's NumPy version correctly.
